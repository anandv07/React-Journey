Building the food ordering system


Components:

Header
    -Logo
    -Nav-items

Body
    -Search
    -RestaurantContainer
        -RestaurantCards

Footer
    -Copyright


Props :
    props are values passed to the Components to make the Component more dynamic
    It is like passing an argument to the normal JS function, but with react component
    The props passed will be get as an object by the component

When having a list of values , use JS map function to loop overit and give to the component

key prop is react is neccessary to uniquely identify the a component

We can give index value as key in react, but not recommended as per react docs.
