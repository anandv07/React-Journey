jsx --> a way to write html like syntax with javascript

Writing a single line jsx doesn't requires any additional parenthesis
But multiline jsx generally needs to be enclosed within the parenthesis ()


React Components:

--> independent and reusable piece of code
--> Comes with two types: Class and Functional component
--> All Components should start with Capital Letter

Functional Component:

--> Works like a normal javascript function , but returns jsx

Component Composition --> having components inside other components (composing)


To write javascript inside jsx, wrap it with curly braces {}

JSX prevents cross site scripting*
